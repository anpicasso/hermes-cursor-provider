# Changelog

## 0.3.6

- Replaces synthesized, post-completion chunks with genuine incremental SDK text streaming for Hermes Relay and async consumers. Awaiting a stream no longer collects the whole run.
- Parses tool-call blocks incrementally, including split delimiters and delimiter text inside JSON arguments; ordinary text is forwarded while Hermes retains tool execution and approvals.
- Preserves usage, session reuse, and terminal error propagation without duplicating the SDK's final text. Closing a stream cancels its run and releases session state, including cancellation during startup.
- Adds first-chunk-before-completion regressions and a real managed Relay gate test. Live Relay/async streaming and a Hermes tool round trip were verified.

## 0.3.5

- Fixes premature fallback under Hermes' managed Relay: streaming requests return a lazy sync/async-compatible stream instead of an unawaited coroutine.
- Keeps SDK work off the Relay event loop, executes each stream only once, and preserves async auxiliary calls, provider errors, and client cancellation.
- Adds regressions for Relay-style iteration, asynchronous streams, closing unconsumed streams, and cancellation; the current-main probe now exercises a real managed Relay stream.

## 0.3.4

- Reports Cursor SDK cache-write tokens to Hermes and maps Cursor's meter-sum `total_tokens` to the OpenAI-compatible prompt-plus-completion total.

## 0.3.3

- Surfaces terminal Cursor SDK failures (including exhausted model usage) as real provider errors instead of empty successful responses, so Hermes logs the Cursor reason before applying its configured fallback.

## 0.3.2

- Reads assistant text from the official SDK run stream before collecting the terminal result. Local SDK runs can leave `RunResult.result` empty even when they emitted a valid answer; that previously looked like an empty model response and triggered Hermes fallback.

## 0.3.1

- Stops requesting Cursor's optional local sandbox, which caused every SDK run to fail on unsupported hosts before Hermes fell back. Private per-agent working directories and the Hermes-owned tool boundary remain unchanged.

## 0.3.0

- Retains one official SDK agent per Hermes conversation/account/model and sends only appended transcript messages.
- Shares one warm SDK bridge per Hermes profile process and preserves retained agents across Hermes client rebuilds.
- Adds an idle-session LRU target, profile/account/model isolation, safe rewrite resets, concurrent-turn isolation, and process-exit cleanup without destructive SDK deletion.
- Documents Cursor cache semantics and exposes `HERMES_CURSOR_MAX_SESSIONS` (default 16).

## 0.2.1

- Always passes Cursor's documented `auto` model explicitly; local SDK agents reject an omitted model.

## 0.2.0

- Replaced the reverse-engineered Cursor Agent protocol with Cursor's official Python SDK and bundled bridge.
- Replaced browser-token OAuth with `CURSOR_API_KEY`, enabling official subscription-backed SDK usage and Hermes auxiliary routing.
- Removed vendored protobuf, HTTP/2 framing, private endpoints, token refresh code, and CLI impersonation.
- Added isolated per-agent workspaces, disabled Cursor built-in tools/MCP, allowlisted Hermes tool-call translation, vision inputs, official model discovery, and sync/async client support.
- Reworked documentation, security model, tests, and current-main verification for the SDK architecture.

## 0.1.0

- Initial standalone current-main Hermes model-provider plugin using Cursor's private Agent protocol.
